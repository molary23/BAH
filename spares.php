<h3>Forklift Batteries</h3> 
<h4>
    A forklift battery actually has two functions: the first function is to provide a power source to the forklift; and the second, and lesser known function, is to provide mass as a counterweight, which aids the forklift’s lifting capacity.
An industrial forklift battery is typically comprised of the following components: battery case, battery cells, battery bars and battery cables.

<h3>Forklift Tires</h3> 
<h4>
All forklifts need tires to operate, but the types of tires and layout of tires on the forklift can vary significantly. Forklifts that use four tires are capable of lifting heavy loads and are versatile for many applications. Three-wheel forklifts are ideal for indoor environments where space is limited and the ability to turn and maneuver efficiently is important.
There are two main types of forklift tires:
Cushion Tires – Generally used for forklifts operating indoors, where surfaces are flat, smooth and consistent.
Pneumatic/ Solid Tires – Pneumatic/ solid tire forklifts are generally used for operating outdoors, where surfaces can be uneven, rough or variable.
